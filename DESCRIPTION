Description: knowYourCG automates the functional analysis of DNA 
    methylation data. The package tests the enrichment of discrete CpG probes 
    across thousands of curated biological and technical features. GSEA-like 
    analysis can be performed on continuous methylation data query sets. 
    knowYourCG can also take beta matrices as input to perform feature 
    aggregation and unsupervised methylation module detection.
